This is a personal project I started to detect an objects within a frame.

To get this working for yourself: 

1. Run the code ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` this will install all necessary libraries.

2. Run the main file and enjoy! ("Esc" key closes the window)

Any questions, please feel free to contact me on any platform.
